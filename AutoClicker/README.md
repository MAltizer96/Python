# AutoClicker

I created an autoclicker with the design being based around automating a roblox video game called Pet Simulator X. It allows for the user to set up a autoclicker, or an auto spacebar push with a delay between each click provided by the user.

The reason for for the auto space bar press is to allow you to not be flaged as AFK in this video game and an autoclicker for farming a big chest in the game. At time the big chest is not meant to be farmed and i had to come up with an idea to attack random objects placed randomly in the world. So i came up with the idea to scan the screen and click as it goes.

The users can provided input for how many rows they would like the scanner to go down before restarting. The starting position is a little bit below the middle of the screen.Each of these classes needed to be threaded so that they can wait on there own without stoping the whole project. The AutoClicker.py and AutoJump.py are simaler in how they are built, but changing what the delay is and what button should be pushed in the loop

The Scangui.py is threaded aswell, but it also gets the users screen size and goes to the middle of that and from there will scan the users screen with the scan method, while it is running, going down just a little on each row.

The GUI for the project was made using the Tkinter library, and following the MVC project stucture. I tried to use the PYAutoGUI for the input, I learned that most video games now a days use something called directinput and PYAutoGUI does not use this type of input. I was able to find a library just like it but uses direct input insed called pydirectinput.
